"""
Population of random solutions. Mutates current population to generate the next.
The MUTATION_PROBABILITY parameter controls the proportion of individuals in the
population that are mutated (the rest is copied without changes).
Prints best, worst and median fitness of individuals in the final population.

QUESTION: does it work? what is missing?
